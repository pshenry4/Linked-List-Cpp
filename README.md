# Linked-List-Cpp
Basic Back-End C++ Project
This C++ project demostrates data being stored for a imaginary insurance company. 
The memberClient.cpp gives the user multiple options to sort through the company data, display the customer data in different formats,
add a new member, as well as delete a new member. The input for the client comes from a text file
that instructs the program on what actions to take.
